A digital audio workstation providing all necessary infrastructure for deep simulation of live instruments; sound synthesis; writing and mixing music and rapid black box modelling of things like guitar amplifiers and pedals, room reverberations, etc. written with the following guidelines that I have in mind:

1. Use a language that is as terse, safe and high level as possible (no C, C++ and Java). Don't be afraid of esoteric hacks if it helps shorten the code.
2. Ideally, this app shouldn't have a GUI at all: splitting and moving records to correct one's sloppy playing is routine and can be automated.
3. Let users quickly implement their own effects without the need to learn badly engineered standards (VST is an example)
